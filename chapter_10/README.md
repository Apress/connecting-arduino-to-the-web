#CHAPTER 10
There are a number of scripts that link together in chapter 10 and evolve through the exercise. Earlier versions of the scripts are in the same folder as the final versions. The earlier versions will have either part1 or part2 added to their name. This means that Game_part2.js isn't the final version of this script, Game.js is.

##RUNNING THE GAME
Once the Arduino is set up and connected, open a terminal window and navigate to the root of the application, which is in javascript/exercise. You will need to install all the modules by typing npm install

Once all the modules are installed, the game will run, once you have updated the serial port your Arduino is connected to.
